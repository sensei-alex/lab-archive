      The root folder (called `/`) contains everything:
      the operating system files, programs, your data, settings, devices, etc,
      organized in subfolders.

      *Everything* in a Linux system *is a file*. Most important for us are:

      - *regular files* that store data or programs as text or digits
      - *directories* (or folders) that hold lists of files
      - *symlinks* that redirect the reader to other files
      - *device files* that represent physical hardware

      You can look at the list of them by typing `ls /`
      (this is the word "list" but without vowels, to make it shorter)
      and hitting enter.
    answers:
      - command: "ls"

      What you've just typed is called a command.
      A command is a program, so calling a command means launching an application.
      Most commands write something to the screen and exit, giving you back the input.

      Notice that every line at which the system expects a command starts with `~ $`.
      The thing listening for the commands and running them is itself a program called `bash` or shell.

      The shell works with one directory at a time and gives that directory to any command you launch.
      To see it, run `pwd` (stands for "present working directory").
    answers:
      - command: "pwd"

      The slash in the beginning is the root directory, other slashes are separators.
      So the directory you are in right now is root -> home -> me. This place is called your home directory.
      The last part, "me", would normally be your name or nickname.
      It's says "me" here because I, snsalx, as the owner of this website, can't know your name.

      The first time you ran `ls`, you wanted to list the contents of a *specific directory*.
      You specified that directory after a space. That's called a *command argument*.

      If you don't give `ls` any arguments, it will use the present working directory. Try that
    hint: Just type `ls` and press enter
    answers:
      - command: "ls"

  - english: |
      The command printed nothing. That's because the current directory is empty.

      Try changing the present working directory (`cd` command) to `/` and look at its contents
    hint: You first need to change the directory to the root using `cd /`. Then list its contents using `ls`
    answers:
      - commands:
          - "cd /"
          - "ls"

      If you run the cd command without any arguments, it will go to your home directory.

      Try making a new directory in your home (`mkdir` command, the argument is the name of the new directory)
      and check that it exists using `ls`. Call the directory documents (all lowercase).
    hint: Run `cd` with no arguments, `mkdir documents`, and then `ls`
    answers:
      - commands:
          - "cd"
          - "mkdir documents"

  - english: |
      The "all lowercase" part matters here because if you create `Documents` it will be considired a separate directory.

      Now go into the newly created `documents`.
    hint: use `cd`
    answers:
      - prompt: "~/documents $"

  - english: |
      Running `cd` like that, with an argument that doesn't start with `/`, navigates relative to the present working directory.
      That means the last command no longer works, because there is a `documents` folder in `/home/me` but not in `/home/me/documents`.

      Return up relative to this directory using `cd ..`. Up is always called `..`, you could also `ls ..`, for example.
    answers:
      - prompt: "~ $"

  - english: |
      You can chain multiple relative jumps. Since you are now in `/home/me`, you can get to the root by running `cd ../..`.

      This tells the system to go up (`/home`) and up from there (`/`).
    answers:
      - prompt: "/ $"

  - english: |
      Go into the `etc` directory
    hint: use `cd`
    answers:
      - prompt: "/etc $"

  - english: |
      Another option for navigating the file tree is absolute jumps. Absolute jumps start from `/`, from root.
      You may recall that your home folder is `/home/me`, so the documents folder created earlier is `/home/me/documents`.
      The same principles apply to any command, if you were to create a projects directory in `/home/me`, you could run
      `mkdir /home/me/projects`.

      Return to the documents directory.
    answers:
      - prompt: "/documents"

      Use `cp` to copy `/tmp/lab.txt` into the current directory. It takes 2 arguments: what to copy and where to copy it.
      Arguments are separated by a space.

      When referencing the present working directory, you can use the relative path `.`
    hint: "`cp /etc/apk/repositories .` will copy the file located in `/etc/apk` named `repositories` into the current working directory"
    answers:
      - command: "cp /tmp/lab.txt ."
      - command: "cp /tmp/lab.txt /home/me/documents"
